# English Capital Letter Recognition

## Overview

This project is designed to recognize English capital letters (A-Z) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model takes in 64x64 pixel images of letters and predicts the corresponding capital letter.

## Model

- **Input**: 64x64 grayscale images of English capital letters.
- **Architecture**: A CNN model built using `TensorFlow`/`Keras`, which is optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Output**: Predicted capital letter (A-Z) based on the input image.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of capital letters. Each letter is stored in a folder named after the letter it represents.

## GUI

A graphical user interface (GUI) is also provided, allowing you to test the model yourself by drawing the letter urself
